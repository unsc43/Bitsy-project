# Bitsy-project
A short bitsy project on a current event - (Chicago Albany fire ) 

## Artist Statement
What I wanted to acomplish with this game was to create an expereince for a player to understand what happened during the events of a recent albany fire, which caused 3 buildings to burn down, and injured a few people as well. Although limited by the application. i.e. Bitsy, I still wanted to add some fun, and interactive moments, so I went with the starting point instead of just being an investigation of what happened after to be a rescue of one of the people who were injured, and later events trying to piece together the mystery of what had happened through talking to others. Beyond that my purpose in making this was to use bitsy to learn to create a compelling interactive story, and in this case with bitsy, although it was very helpful to use when trying to figure out how to get narrative through without having super advanced tools, since bitsy is more ofa  simplistic engine. I used bitsy itself to explain the complex narrative through multiple parts, while traversing the buildings. To rescuing the guy, to simply changing the color scheme to represent the time of day. instead of each transition showing a new time I wanted it to be a bit more of a world storytelling point.
